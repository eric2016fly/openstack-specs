 OpenStack Cross-Project Specifications and Policies
=====================================================

This repository contains specifications and policies that apply to
OpenStack as a whole.

.. note:: The OpenStack Cross-Project specification process has been
          deprecated in favor of `OpenStack-wide Goals
          <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/index.html>`__ and
          `OpenStack SIGs <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStack_SIGs>`__.
          The documents found here are still useful as historical artifacts,
          but at this time the specifications are not actionable
